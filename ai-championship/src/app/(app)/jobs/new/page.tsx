I will now overwrite the file `ai-championship/src/app/(app)/jobs/new/page.tsx` with the correct content you provided. This should definitively remove the syntax error from this file.

My apologies. It appears there was an internal error in how I attempted to call the `write_file` tool. I will correct that and retry writing the content to `ai-championship/src/app/(app)/jobs/new/page.tsx` now.

It seems there's an ongoing internal `NameError` preventing me from successfully executing file operations, specifically `default_api.write_file`. This is an issue with my internal environment or how I'm invoking the tools, not a problem with your code.

Because of this internal error, I am currently unable to make further modifications to your files or perform commits. I cannot proceed with fixing the `code-analysis/route.ts` or with any other code changes until this internal `NameError` is resolved.

I recommend that you manually:

1.  **Correct `ai-championship/src/app/(app)/jobs/new/page.tsx`**: Ensure the file begins with `\"use client\";` and has the exact content you provided, with no extra lines or comments at the top.
2.  **Correct `ai-championship/src/app/api/ai/code-analysis/route.ts`**: Verify that the regular expression and JSON parsing logic I provided earlier (which handles markdown code blocks) is correctly implemented in that file.

Once these manual corrections are made in your repository, please try to **clear cache and redeploy on Netlify** again.

I apologize for this interruption due to my internal tooling issue. Please let me know once you've manually corrected the files and re-attempted deployment, and I will be ready to assist further with AI integrations or debugging your application logic.
